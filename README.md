# Breakout Clone

Created as a learning exercise, Breakout Clone is a small one-man project developped by Louis Corbel. 

It's purpose is to recreate the all-time classic game that is Breakout from scratch in Unity and learn along the way.

Some of the key skills that this project helped consolidate include the following :

- Prefab management
- Rigidbody's dynamic physics
- Layers management
- Basic UI and on-click button interaction
